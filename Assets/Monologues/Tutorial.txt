Welcome to Mouse Wars! 
I'm Jerry, your host for the evening.
I’ll walk you through the basics…
Mouse Wars is a 2 player deck building card game played in 3D digital space.
You will be drawing cards, summoning mice, giving them orders, and watching them fight!
When the game starts, first place your Mouse Hole, which will represent your team's health.
Then you’re gonna Draw Cards by placing your hand over the square to your right.
Just touch your hand to a card to pick it up. 
Once you have it, you can hold space to examine it up close. 
Left click to play it on the board and summon a mouse!
You can also right click to let the card go back into your hand. 
Each mouse card has its own stats.
Mice have move speed, a movement radius, damage, health, and alcohol points.
Your alcohol points will increase every turn, allowing you to place more mice.
When your mice are on the board, click them to give Move Orders. 
Once a mouse is selected, you will see its move radius and can click anywhere to move it.
Right clicking will cancel the move. 
You can always overwrite the move during the planning stage by selecting the mouse again. 
Plans become final when you end the phase by pressing Enter.
When both players have finished planning, their orders will be carried out simultaneously in the Action Phase.
As mice approach each other, they will automatically fight one another. 
These fights are known as tussles. 
Your real goal is to get your mice into the opponent’s Mouse Hole.
And that’s about it!!!
Good luck champ!
