“Welcome to Mouse Wars!”
“I’ll walk you through the basics…” 
“When the game starts, first place your Mouse Hole, which will represent your health”
“Then you’re gonna Draw Cards”
“Then you can play cards from your hand (as long as you have enough alcohol points)”
“Your alcohol points will increase every turn, allowing you to place more mice” 
“When your mice are on the board, click them to give Move Orders” 
“To cancel placing a card or giving a move order, right click” 
“When you’re done giving orders, press Enter to pass the turn”
“When both of you have given Move Orders, they will be carried out simultaneously in the Action Phase.”
“Mice will fight each other” 
“Your real goal is to get your mice into the opponent’s Mouse Hole”
“And that’s about it!!”
“Good luck champ!”
